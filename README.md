# Clone of Lexpin's Instagram Profile Page

Clone made with HTML and SASS of the Lexpin's profile page on Instagram.

## Folder structure

The project features an implementation of the 7-1 SASS architecture pattern, which organizes SASS files into seven different folders, with one main file to import them all. This structure enhances maintainability and scalability of the stylesheets.

```
instagram-clone/
|-- assets/
|   |-- img/
|   |-- svg/
|-- css/
|-- sass/
|   |-- base/
|   |   |-- _base.scss
|   |   |-- _reset.scss
|   |-- components/
|   |-- layouts/
|   |-- utils/
|   |-- main.scss
|-- index.html
|-- README.md
```

## How to use

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Bafaf23/Instagram.git
   ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the Instagram profile page clone.

3. To modify the styles, edit the SASS files located in the `sass/` directory and compile them to CSS.

## Notes from the developer

In this jungle of code you can find: happiness from doing what I love, love, sweat, tears, lots of stress, hope, coffee, curses, Agatha All Along spells.
Anyway, the important thing is to enjoy the process, which I did quite a bit in this project, even though I didn't ask almost anything, hehe.
After all this drama, we can move forward. Happy old lady in the salvation of this code.
